# FinalYearProject

m8up is an iOS app designed to help users grow their social circles, which I created for my final year project in college. It allows you to connect to others with a simple swipe gesture, providing they meet the criteria that you have specified such as a similar niche interest.

The app makes use of Push notifications, instant messaging, and location services. 
It was written in Swift, though an Objective-C header was required for the integration of third party libraries. 

Technologies used: Swift, Objective-C, Xcode, Cocoapods, Parse, Firebase, Sketch 3, and GitHub.
